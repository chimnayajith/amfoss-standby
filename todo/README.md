# ToDo List using Django

It took a while to get to know how Django worked and due to some personal and unforeseen reasons a lot of my time was lost. 

Had to hustle , the webpage is not that good in terms of the design and css.



There was one bug I found but couldn't fix. 

Suppose there are two users User1 and User2. Each task has a task id. User2 cannot access the task list of User1 and vice-versa. But when going to either /update/{task.id} or /delete/{task.id} , it can be accessed.
